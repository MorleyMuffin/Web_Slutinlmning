    <h3>Plant info</h3>
    <p>Cannabis plants, comprising various strains like Cannabis sativa, indica, and hybrids, contain a complex array of compounds, most notably THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). THC is responsible for the psychoactive effects, inducing a sense of euphoria, relaxation, and altered perception. CBD, on the other hand, is non-psychoactive and is associated with therapeutic properties, offering potential relief from anxiety, pain, and inflammation.
        The effects of cannabis vary widely depending on the strain, consumption method, and individual tolerance. Sativa strains are often energizing and mood-enhancing, while indicas tend to induce relaxation and sedation. Hybrid strains combine elements of both.
        Medical research explores cannabis for its potential in managing various conditions, from chronic pain to epilepsy. However, its recreational use raises legal and social considerations. Understanding the diverse effects of cannabis aids in making informed choices, whether for therapeutic or recreational purposes.</p>
    <h3>Effects of catnip</h3>
    <p>Catnip, the enchanting herb in the mint family, has a captivating effect on our feline friends.
        When cats encounter catnip, it stimulates their sensory receptors, particularly those in the nasal tissue.
        The active compound, nepetalactone, binds to these receptors, triggering a range of behaviors that can include rolling, rubbing, and playful antics.
        This botanical interaction induces a temporary state of euphoria, making catnip a source of joy for our furry companions.
        The effects are relatively short-lived, typically lasting around 10-15 minutes, followed by a refractory period during which cats become temporarily immune to its allure.
        Not all cats are affected, as sensitivity to catnip is hereditary, but for those who are, it adds a whimsical and entertaining dimension to their feline experience.</p>
